  "title": "About Database, this is my second blog",
  "content": "<h3><strong>What is a database?</strong></h3><p>A database is information that is set up for easy access, management and updating. Computer databases typically store aggregations of <a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/data\">data</a> records or <a href=\"https://searchsqlserver.techtarget.com/definition/flat-file\">files</a> that contain information, such as sales transactions, customer data, financials and product information.</p><h3><strong>Types of databases</strong></h3><p>There are many types of databases. They may be classified according to content type: bibliographic, full text, numeric and images. In computing, databases are often classified based on the organizational approach they use.</p><p>Some of the main organizational databases include the following:</p><p><strong>Relational.</strong> This tabular approach defines data so it can be reorganized and accessed in many ways. Relational databases are comprised of <a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/table\">tables</a>. Data is placed into predefined categories in those tables. Each table has columns with at least one data category, and rows that have a certain data instance for the categories which are defined in the columns. Information in a relational database about a specific customer is organized into rows, columns and tables. These are indexed to make it easier to search using SQL or NoSQL queries.</p><p>Relational databases use SQL in their user and <a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/application-program-interface-API\">application program interfaces</a>. A new data category can easily be added to a relational database without having to change the existing applications. A relational database management system (RDBMS) is used to store, manage, query and retrieve data in a relational database.</p><p>Typically, the RDBMS gives users the ability to control read/write access, specify report generation and analyze use. Some databases offer atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability, or <a href=\"https://searchsqlserver.techtarget.com/definition/ACID\">ACID</a>, compliance to guarantee that data is consistent and that transactions are complete.</p><p><strong>Distributed.</strong> This database stores records or files in several physical locations. Data processing is also spread out and replicated across different parts of the network.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchoracle/definition/distributed-database\">Distributed databases</a> can be homogeneous, where all physical locations have the same underlying hardware and run the same operating systems and database applications. They can also be heterogeneous. In those cases, the hardware, OS and database applications can be different in the various locations.</p><p><strong>Cloud. </strong>These databases are built in a public, private or hybrid cloud for a <a href=\"https://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/definition/virtualization\">virtualized environment</a>. Users are charged based on how much storage and bandwidth they use. They also get scalability on demand and high availability<strong>. </strong>These databases can work with applications deployed as <a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/definition/Software-as-a-Service\">software as a service</a>.</p><p><strong>NoSQL. </strong>NoSQL databases are good when dealing with large collections of distributed data. They can address big data performance issues better than relational databases. They also do well analyzing large <a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchbusinessanalytics/definition/unstructured-data\">unstructured</a> data sets and data on <a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/virtual-server\">virtual servers</a> in the cloud. These databases can also be called non-relational databases.</p><p><strong>Object-oriented. </strong>These databases hold data created using <a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP\">object-oriented programming</a> languages. They focus on organizing objects rather than actions and data rather than logic. For instance, an image data record would be a data object, rather than an <a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/alphanumeric-alphameric\">alphanumeric</a> value.</p><p><strong>Graph. </strong>These databases are a type of NoSQL database. They store, map and query relationships using concepts from graph theory. Graph databases are made up of nodes and edges. Nodes are entities and connect the nodes.</p><p>These databases are <a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/feature/The-top-5-graph-database-advantages-for-enterprises\">often used to analyze interconnections</a>. Graph databases are often used to analyze data about customers as they interact with a business on webpages and in social media.</p><p>Graph databases use <a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/SPARQL\">SPARQL</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/definition/declarative-programming\">declarative programming</a> language and protocol, for analytics. SPARQL can perform all the analytics that SQL can perform, and can also be used for semantic analysis, or the examination of relationships. This makes it useful for performing analytics on data sets that have both <a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/structured-data\">structured</a> and unstructured data. SPARQL lets users perform analytics on information stored in a relational database, as well as friend-of-a-friend relationships, <a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/PageRank\">PageRank</a> and shortest path.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>",

A Mass service (which is sometimes called Communion or Eucharist) is where Christians remember that Jesus died and then came back to life. The 'Christ-Mass' service was the only one that was allowed to take place after sunset (and before sunrise the next day), so people had it at Midnight! So we get the name Christ-Mass, shortened to Christmas.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/\">Christmas is now celebrated by people around the world</a>, whether they are Christians or not. It's a time when family and friends come together and remember the good things they have. People, and especially children, also like Christmas as it's <a href=\"https://www.whychristmas.com/customs/presents\">a time when you give and receive presents</a>!</p><h2>The Date of Christmas</h2><p><img src=\"https://www.whychristmas.com/i/25th-300.svg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>No one knows the real birthday of Jesus! No date is given in the Bible, so why do we celebrate it on the 25th December? The early Christians certainly had many arguments as to when it should be celebrated! Also, the birth of Jesus probably didn't happen in the year 1 but slightly earlier, somewhere between 2 BCE/BC and 7 BCE/BC, possibly in 4 BCE/BC (there isn't a 0 - the years go from 1 BC/BCE to 1!).</p><p>The first recorded date of Christmas being celebrated on December 25th was in 336, during the time of the Roman Emperor Constantine (he was the first Christian Roman Emperor). But it was not an official Roman state festival at this time.</p><p>However, there are many different traditions and theories as to why Christmas is celebrated on December 25th.</p><p>A very early Christian tradition said that the day when <a href=\"https://www.whychristmas.com/story/angel-mary\">Mary was told that she would have a very special baby</a>, Jesus (called the Annunciation) was on March 25th - and it's still celebrated today on the 25th March. Nine months after the 25th March is the 25th December!</p><p>March 25th was also the day some early Christians thought the world had been made, and also the day that Jesus died on when he was an adult and they thought that Jesus was conceived and had died on the same day of the year. The date was chosen as it was near the March/Vernal Equinox (when the date and night are of equal length in March).</p><p>Jesus died on Nisan 14 in the Jewish calendar - the date of the Jewish festival of Passover. The Jewish calendar is lunar (based on the moon, rather than fixed dates) and so it moves around with dates on the Gregorian calendar. Saint Ephrem the Syrian (306 – 373) taught that Jesus was conceived on Nisan 10! So March 25th became a 'fixed' date on the Gregorian calendar to mark these 'moveable' dates on the Jewish calendar.</p><h2>The Solstice, Yalda and Saturnalia</h2><p>The Winter Solstice is the day where there is the shortest time between the sun rising and the sun setting. It happens on December 21st or 22nd in the Northern Hemisphere. (In the Southern Hemisphere, this time is the Summer Solstice and the Winter Solstice happens in late June.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To pre-Christians/pagans this meant that they knew that the days would start getting lighter and longer and the nights would become shorter - marking a change in the seasons. To celebrate people had a mid-winter festival to celebrate the sun 'winning' over the darkness of winter. At this time, animals which had been kept for food were also often killed to save having to feed them all through the winter and some drinks which had been brewing since the autumn/harvest would also be ready to drink. So it was a good time to have a celebration with things to eat and drink before the rest of the winter happened. (We still have New Year celebrations near this time now!)</p><p>In Scandinavia, and some other parts of northern Europe, the time around the Winter Solstice is known as Yule (although the word Yule only seems to date to about the year 300). In Eastern Europe the mid-winter festival is called Koleda.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/iran\">Iranian/Persian culture, the winter solstice is known as 'Yalda Night' or 'Shab-e Chelleh'</a> and it's a time when families and friends come together to eat, drink and recite poetry. Shab-e Chelleh means 'night of forty' as it happens forty nights into winter. The word Yalda means 'birth' and comes from early Christians living in Persia celebrating the birth of Jesus around this time. Eating, fruits, nuts, pomegranates and watermelons are important at Yalda/Chelleh and you can get Yalda cakes which look like watermelons!</p><p>The Roman Festival of Saturnalia took place between December 17th and 23rd and honoured the Roman god Saturn. The Romans also thought that the Solstice took place on December 25th. It's also thought that in 274 the Roman emperor Aurelian created 'Dies Natalis Solis Invicti' (meaning 'birthday of the unconquered sun') also called 'Sol Invictus' and it was held on December 25th.</p><p>Because of the dates, <a href=\"https://www.whychristmas.com/customs/misconceptions\">some people say that the Christians 'took over' December 25th from these Roman festivals and/or Yule</a>. However, there are records going back to around 200 of early Christians connecting the Nisan 14 to the 25th March, and so 25th December was a 'Christian' festival date many years before 'Sol Invictus'! (More recent studies have also found that the 'Sol Invictus' connection didn't appear until the 12th century and it's from one scribbled note in the margins of a manuscript. There's also evidence that 'Sol Invictus' might also have happened in October and not December anyway!)</p><h2>Some more dates!</h2><p>Christmas had also been celebrated by the early Church on January 6th, when they also celebrated the <a href=\"https://www.whychristmas.com/customs/epiphany\">Epiphany</a> (which means the revelation that Jesus was God's son) and the Baptism of Jesus. (Like the December 25th date above, this was based on a calculation of Jesus's death/conception but from the 6th April not the 25th March.) Now Epiphany mainly celebrates <a href=\"https://www.whychristmas.com/story/wisemen\">the visit of the Wise Men to the baby Jesus</a>, but back then it celebrated both things! Jesus's Baptism was originally seen as more important than his birth, as this was when he started his ministry.</p><p>The Jewish festival of Lights, <a href=\"https://www.whychristmas.com/customs/hanukkah\">Hanukkah</a> starts on the eve of the Kislev 25 (the month in the Jewish calendar that occurs at about the same time as December). Hanukkah celebrates when the Jewish people were able to re-dedicate and worship in their Temple, in Jerusalem, again following many years of not being allowed to practice their religion.</p><p>Jesus was a Jew, so this could be another reason that helped the early Church choose December the 25th for the date of Christmas!</p><p>Most of the world uses the 'Gregorian Calendar' implemented by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582. Before that the 'Roman' or Julian Calendar was used (named after Julius Caesar). The Gregorian calendar is more accurate than the Roman calendar which had too many days in a year! When the switch was made 10 days were lost, so that the day that followed the 4th October 1582 was 15th October 1582. In the UK the change of calendars was made in 1752. The day after 2nd September 1752 was 14th September 1752.</p><p>Many Orthodox and Coptic Churches still use the Julian Calendar and so celebrate Christmas on the 7th January (which is when December 25th would have been on the Julian calendar). And the Armenian Apostolic Church celebrates it on the 6th January! In some part of the UK, January 6th is still called 'Old Christmas' as this would have been the day that Christmas would have celebrated on, if the calendar hadn't been changed. Some people didn't want to use the new calendar as they thought it 'cheated' them out of 11 days!</p><p>Christians believe that Jesus is the light of the world, so the early Christians thought that this was the right time to celebrate the birth of Jesus. They also took over some of the customs from the Winter Solstice and gave them Christian meanings, like <a href=\"https://www.whychristmas.com/customs/holly-and-ivy\">Holly</a>, <a href=\"https://www.whychristmas.com/customs/mistletoe\">Mistletoe</a> and even <a href=\"https://www.whychristmas.com/customs/carols-history\">Christmas Carols</a>!</p><p>St Augustine of Canterbury was the person who probably started the widespread celebration of Christmas in large parts of <a href=\"https://www.whychristmas.com/cultures/uk\">England</a> by introducing Christianity to the regions run by the Anglo-Saxons in the 6th century (other Celtic parts of Britain were already Christian but there aren't many documents about if or how they celebrated the birth of Jesus). St Augustine of Canterbury was sent by Pope Gregory the Great in Rome and that church used the Roman Calendar, so western countries celebrate Christmas on the 25th December. Then people from Britain and Western Europe took Christmas on the 25th December all over the world!</p><p><a href=\"https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-topics/new-testament/how-december-25-became-christmas/\">If you'd like to know more about the history behind the dating of Christmas, then read this very good article on Bible History Daily</a> (goes to another site).</p><h2>So when was Jesus Born?</h2><p>There's a strong and practical reason why Jesus might not have been born in the winter, but in the spring or the autumn! It can get very cold in the winter and it's unlikely that the <a href=\"https://www.whychristmas.com/story/shepherds\">shepherds would have been keeping sheep out on the hills</a> (as those hills can get quite a lot of snow sometimes!).</p><p>During the spring (in March or April) there's a Jewish festival called 'Passover'. This festival remembers when the Jews had escaped from slavery in Egypt about 1500 years before Jesus was born. Lots of lambs would have been needed during the Passover Festival, to be sacrificed in the Temple in Jerusalem. Jews from all over the Roman Empire traveled to Jerusalem for the Passover Festival, so it would have been a good time for the Romans to take a census. <a href=\"https://www.whychristmas.com/story/birth\">Mary and Joseph went to Bethlehem for the census</a> (Bethlehem is about six miles from Jerusalem).</p><p>In the autumn (in September or October) there's the Jewish festival of 'Sukkot' or 'The Feast of Tabernacles'. It's the festival that's mentioned the most times in the Bible! It is when Jewish people remember that they depended on God for all they had after they had escaped from Egypt and spent 40 years in the desert. It also celebrates the end of the harvest. During the festival, Jews live outside in temporary shelters (the word 'tabernacle' come from a latin word meaning 'booth' or 'hut').</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many people who have studied the Bible, think that Sukkot would be a likely time for the birth of Jesus as it might fit with the description of there being 'no room in the inn'. It also would have been a good time to take the Roman Census as many Jews went to Jerusalem for the festival and they would have brought their own tents/shelters with them! (It wouldn't have been practical for Joseph and Mary to carry their own shelter as Mary was pregnant.)</p><p>The possibilities for the <a href=\"https://www.whychristmas.com/customs/star-of-bethlehem\">Star of Bethlehem</a> seems to point either spring or autumn.</p><p>The possible dating of Jesus birth can also be taken from <a href=\"https://www.whychristmas.com/story/marys-relatives\">when Zechariah (who was married to Mary's cousin Elizabeth) was on duty in the Jewish Temple as a Priest and had an amazing experience</a>. <a href=\"https://www.psephizo.com/biblical-studies/when-was-jesus-really-born-spoiler-not-in-december/\">There is an excellent article on the dating of Christmas based on the dates of Zechariah's experience, on the blog of theologian, Ian Paul</a> (goes to another site). With those dates, you get Jesus being born in September - which also fits with Sukkot!</p><p>In the Bible, John 1:14 says <i>\"The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us...\"</i>. In Greek the word for 'dwelling' is 'eskēnōsen' (ἐσκήνωσεν) which means 'to pitch and live in a tent/encampment'. In Hebrew this translates as 'mishkan' ('מִשְׁכַּן' meaning to dwell and it's also the name given to the Tabernacle which was where God 'dwelled' in the Jewish and Christian faith during the Jews time in the wilderness in the book of Exodus) and/or 'sukkah' ('סוכה'). So John seems to have clearly been drawing on this analogy saying that Jesus 'pitched his tent' as a human and also quite possibly he is making the link to the time of Jesus's birth. John certainly knew both Jesus and Mary and so would have known when Jesus was born!</p><p>The year that Jesus was born isn't known. The calendar system we have now was created in the 6th Century by a monk called Dionysius Exiguus. He was actually trying to create a better system for working out when Easter should be celebrated, based on a new calendar with the birth of Jesus being in the year 1. However, he made a mistake in his maths and so got the possible year of Jesus's birth wrong!</p><p>Most scholars now think that Jesus was born between 2 BCE/BC and 7 BCE/BC, probably in 3 or 4 BCE/BC. Before Dionysius's new calendars, years were normally dated from the reigns of Roman Emperors. The new calendar became more widely used from the 8th Century when the 'Venerable Bede of Northumbria' used it in his 'new' history book! There is no year '0'. Bede started dating things before the year 1 and used 1 BCE/BC as the first year before 1. At that time in Europe, the number 0 didn't exist in maths - it only arrived in Europe in the 11th to 13th centuries!</p><p>So whenever you celebrate Christmas, remember that you're celebrating a real event that happened about 2000 years ago, that God sent his Son into the world as a Christmas present for everyone!</p><p>As well as Christmas and the solstice, there are some other festivals that are held in late December. <a href=\"https://www.whychristmas.com/customs/hanukkah\">Hanukkah</a> is celebrated by Jews; and the festival of <a href=\"https://www.whychristmas.com/customs/kwanzaa\">Kwanzaa</a> is celebrated by some Africans and African Americans takes place from December 26th to January 1st.</p>",

  "title": "Harry Potter",
  "content": "<h2><strong>The Harry Potter Book Series</strong></h2><p><i><strong>Harry Potter</strong></i> is a series of novels by British author <strong>J. K. Rowling</strong>. The novels follow Harry Potter, an 11-year-old boy who discovers he is the son of famous wizards and will attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry learns of an entire society of wizards and witches. He befriends several Hogwarts students and teachers along his journey. Each novel chronicles one year in Harry's life and his adventures discovering the events that led to his parents' deaths at the hands of Lord Voldermort, a dark wizard believed long dead.</p><p>The novels were monumentally popular, quickly becoming pop culture. <i>Harry Potter</i> characters have become famous even among those who have never read the books. In its first twenty years, the series sold half a billion copies. Their place as literature has also been praised, with many comparing the series to other works like <i>His Dark Materials</i> and the works of Roald Dahl.</p><h3><strong>J.K. Rowling: Creator of the Harry Potter Series and Characters</strong></h3><p>Joanne Rowling, known to audiences as J. K. Rowling, was born on July 31, 1965, near Bristol. As a child, she wrote her first book when she was six years old. Rowling studied at Exeter University and moved to London after graduating. In 1990, she first conceived the world of <i>Harry Potter</i> while sitting in a train, then spent five years worldbuilding.</p><p>She decided to publish under the pen name \"J. K. Rowling,\" the \"K\" being her grandmother's first initial, because she felt boys would not want to read a book by a woman. The first book in the series, <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,</i> was published in 1997.</p><p>The <i>Harry Potter</i> characters, as much as the world they inhabit, are some of the reasons for the series' appeal. Most characters are grounded, and their stories continue long after the series ended, with Rowling publishing information on their lives after the events of the novels.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://study.com/academy/lesson/harry-potter-characters-author-facts.html#quiz-course-links\"><strong>Lesson</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://study.com/academy/practice/quiz-worksheet-harry-potter-characters-author.html\"><strong>Quiz</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://study.com/academy/course/9th-grade-english-homework-help.html\"><strong>Course</strong></a></li></ul><p><strong>7.6K views</strong></p><h2><strong>List of Harry Potter Characters</strong></h2><p>A full list of <i>Harry Potter</i> characters would require dozens of entries. The series covers various students at Hogwarts, each in a different House. When students first arrive, they are sorted into one of four Houses: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff. Selection is based on the student's strengths, competence, and desires. The two main houses in the narrative are Gryffindor and Slytherin. With the main protagonists, <i>Harry Potter</i> characters in Gryffindor are typically depicted as being good. Most Slytherin characters, on the other hand, are antagonists.</p><p>Several characters are also \"muggles,\" a term in the wizarding world for non-magical folk. In the real world, \"muggle\" is now in the Oxford English Dictionary and means someone who is inexperienced in a certain subject.</p><h3><strong>Main Characters</strong></h3><p><i>Harry Potter</i>'s main characters are a combination of students and teachers at Hogwarts.</p><ul><li>Harry Potter: Harry is the main protagonist. He is orphaned as a baby when his parents, James and Lily Potter, are killed by Voldemort for resisting his attempted takeover of the wizarding world. As a final act of love, Lily protected Harry from Voldemort's curse, an act which saved his life but left him with a lightning-bolt-shaped scar on his forehead. When he arrives at Hogwarts, Harry is sorted into Gryffindor House. The events leading up to the Second Wizard War require him to constantly get into trouble with various authority figures, a trait he inherited from his father. Over the next seven years, he learns more about his parents', grows into an accomplished wizard, and defeats Voldemort.</li><li>Ron Weasley: Ron, also a Gryffindor, is the first classmate Harry befriends. He is one of six kids to Molly and Arthur Weasley. Ron struggles with self-esteem, thinking himself not as smart as others or as lucky. While he doesn't have a passion for learning, he nevertheless ends the series with very high marks, showing his aptitude. The epilogue shows he married Hermione.</li><li>Hermione Granger: The reasonable and logical third of the main characters, Hermione is an exceptional witch who befriends Harry and Ron on the first trip to Hogwarts. A Gryffindor, Hermione begins the series obsessed with following the rules no matter what. However, her friendship with Ron and Harry shows her she can relax, and she becomes integral to various plots as her knowledge of magic is unmatched by her peers. The epilogue shows she has two children with Ron.</li><li>Albus Dumbledore: Professor Dumbledore is the headmaster at Hogwarts. An old and powerful wizard, he is kind to the students and offers sincere help. Most students and staff are loyal to him, as they rightfully feel he cares deeply for the school and those within. He was tragically murdered by Severus Snape, though later events reveal he and Snape were working together to get Snape back into Voldemort's graces as a spy. The murder was actually at Dumbledore's request as he was already dying from a fatal curse.</li><li>Lord Voldemort/ Tom Riddle: The main antagonist, Voldemort is a dark wizard who tried to take over the wizarding world. Born Tom Riddle, Voldemort nearly succeeded in his attempts, but was thwarted when he tried to curse Harry Potter as an infant. The curse backfired and supposedly killed him. In reality, Voldemort spent the next decade as a half-dead ghost before eventually returning to a physical body in the fourth novel, <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i>. He spends the remaining novels gathering his armies, culminating in the Second Wizarding War and his eventual defeat at the hands of Harry Potter during the Battle of Hogwarts.</li></ul><h3><strong>Gryffindor Characters</strong></h3>",

Instead of using tables and rows as in the traditional relational databases, MongoDB makes use of collections and documents. Documents consist of key-value pairs which are the basic unit of data in MongoDB. Collections contain sets of documents and function which is the equivalent of relational database tables. MongoDB is a database which came into light around the mid-2000s.</p><p>In this tutorial, you will learn-</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.guru99.com/what-is-mongodb.html#2\">MongoDB Features</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.guru99.com/what-is-mongodb.html#3\">MongoDB Example</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.guru99.com/what-is-mongodb.html#4\">Key Components of MongoDB Architecture</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.guru99.com/what-is-mongodb.html#5\">Why Use MongoDB</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.guru99.com/what-is-mongodb.html#6\">Data Modelling in MongoDB</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.guru99.com/what-is-mongodb.html#7\">Difference between MongoDB &amp; RDBMS</a></li></ul><h2>MongoDB Features</h2><ol><li>Each database contains collections which in turn contains documents. Each document can be different with a varying number of fields. The size and content of each document can be different from each other.</li><li>The document structure is more in line with how developers construct their classes and objects in their respective programming languages. Developers will often say that their classes are not rows and columns but have a clear structure with key-value pairs.</li><li>The rows (or documents as called in MongoDB) doesn’t need to have a schema defined beforehand. Instead, the fields can be created on the fly.</li><li>The data model available within MongoDB allows you to represent hierarchical relationships, to store arrays, and other more complex structures more easily.</li><li>Scalability – The MongoDB environments are very scalable. Companies across the world have defined clusters with some of them running 100+ nodes with around millions of documents within the database</li></ol><h2>MongoDB Example</h2><p>The below example shows how a document can be modeled in MongoDB.</p><ol><li>The _id field is added by MongoDB to uniquely identify the document in the collection.</li><li>What you can note is that the Order Data (OrderID, Product, and Quantity ) which in RDBMS will normally be stored in a separate table, while in MongoDB it is actually stored as an embedded document in the collection itself. This is one of the key differences in how data is modeled in MongoDB.</li></ol><p><img src=\"https://www.guru99.com/images/MongoDB/112015_1051_Introductio1.png\" alt=\"MongoDB Tutorial for Beginners\"></p><h2>Key Components of MongoDB Architecture</h2><p>Below are a few of the common terms used in MongoDB</p><ol><li><strong>_id</strong> – This is a field required in every MongoDB document. The _id field represents a unique value in the MongoDB document. The _id field is like the document’s primary key. If you create a new document without an _id field, MongoDB will automatically create the field. So for example, if we see the example of the above customer table, Mongo DB will add a 24 digit unique identifier to each document in the collection.</li></ol><figure class=\"table\"><table><thead><tr><th>_Id</th><th>CustomerID</th><th>CustomerName</th><th>OrderID</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>563479cc8a8a4246bd27d784</td><td>11</td><td>Guru99</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>563479cc7a8a4246bd47d784</td><td>22</td><td>Trevor Smith</td><td>222</td></tr><tr><td>563479cc9a8a4246bd57d784</td><td>33</td><td>Nicole</td><td>333</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><ol><li><strong>Collection</strong> – This is a grouping of MongoDB documents. A collection is the equivalent of a table which is created in any other RDMS such as Oracle or MS SQL. A collection exists within a single database. As seen from the introduction collections don’t enforce any sort of structure.</li><li><strong>Cursor</strong> – This is a pointer to the result set of a query. Clients can iterate through a cursor to retrieve results.</li><li><strong>Database</strong> – This is a container for collections like in RDMS wherein it is a container for tables. Each database gets its own set of files on the file system. A MongoDB server can store multiple databases.</li><li><strong>Document</strong> – A record in a MongoDB collection is basically called a document. The document, in turn, will consist of field name and values.</li><li><strong>Field</strong> – A name-value pair in a document. A document has zero or more fields. Fields are analogous to columns in relational databases.The following diagram shows an example of Fields with Key value pairs. So in the example below CustomerID and 11 is one of the key value pair’s defined in the document.</li></ol><p><br>&nbsp;</p>",

Its headquarters are in <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Mountain-View-California\">Mountain View</a>, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/California-state\">California</a>.</p><p>Google began as an online search firm, but it now offers more than 50 Internet services and products, from <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/e-mail\">e-mail</a> and online document creation to <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/software\">software</a> for <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/mobile-telephone\">mobile phones</a> and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/tablet-computer\">tablet computers</a>. In addition, its 2012 acquisition of Motorola Mobility put it in the position to sell hardware in the form of mobile phones. Google’s broad product portfolio and size make it one of the top four influential companies in the high-tech marketplace, along with <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Apple-Inc\">Apple</a>, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/International-Business-Machines-Corporation\">IBM</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Microsoft-Corporation\">Microsoft</a>. Despite this <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/myriad\">myriad</a> of products, its original search tool remains the core of its success. In 2016 Alphabet earned nearly all of its revenue from Google <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/advertising\">advertising</a> based on users’ search requests.</p><h2>Searching for business</h2><p>Brin and Page, who met as graduate students at <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Stanford-University\">Stanford University</a>, were intrigued with the idea of extracting meaning from the mass of data accumulating on the Internet. They began working from Page’s dormitory room at Stanford to devise a new type of search technology, which they dubbed BackRub. The key was to leverage Web users’ own ranking abilities by tracking each <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/website\">Web site’s</a> “backing links”—that is, the number of other pages linked to them. Most search engines simply returned a list of Web sites ranked by how often a search phrase appeared on them. Brin and Page incorporated into the search function the number of links each Web site had; i.e., a Web site with thousands of links would logically be more valuable than one with just a few links, and the search engine thus would place the heavily linked site higher on a list of possibilities. Further, a link from a heavily linked Web site would be a more valuable “vote” than one from a more obscure Web site.</p><p>In mid-1998 Brin and Page began receiving outside financing (one of their first investors was Andy Bechtolsheim, a cofounder of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sun-Microsystems-Inc\">Sun Microsystems, Inc.</a>). They ultimately raised about $1 million from investors, family, and friends and set up shop in <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Menlo-Park-California\">Menlo Park</a>, California, under the name Google, which was <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/derived\">derived</a> from a misspelling of Page’s original planned name, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/googol\"><i>googol</i></a> (a mathematical term for the number one followed by 100 zeroes). By mid-1999, when Google received a $25 million round of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/venture-capital\">venture capital</a> funding, it was processing 500,000 queries per day. Activity began to explode in 2000, when Google became the client search engine for one of the Web’s most popular sites, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Yahoo-Inc\">Yahoo!</a>. By 2004, when Yahoo! dispensed with Google’s services, users were searching on Google 200 million times a day. That growth only continued: by the end of 2011 Google was handling some three billion searches per day. The company’s name became so <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ubiquitous\">ubiquitous</a> that it entered the lexicon as a verb: <i>to google</i> became a common expression for searching the Internet.</p><p>To accommodate this unprecedented mass of data, Google built 11 data centres around the world, each of them containing several hundred thousand servers (basically, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/technology/multiprocessing\">multiprocessor</a> personal computers and hard drives mounted in specially constructed racks). Google’s interlinked computers probably number several million. The heart of Google’s operation, however, is built around three <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/proprietary\">proprietary</a> pieces of computer code: Google File System (GFS), Bigtable, and MapReduce. GFS handles the storage of data in “chunks” across several machines; Bigtable is the company’s database program; and MapReduce is used by Google to generate higher-level data (e.g., putting together an index of Web pages that contain the words “Chicago,” “theatre,” and “participatory”).</p><p>The extraordinary growth of Google led to internal management problems. Almost from the beginning, investors felt that Brin and Page needed an experienced manager at the helm, and in 2001 they agreed to hire <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Eric-Schmidt\">Eric Schmidt</a> as chairman and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/chief-executive-officer\">chief executive officer</a> (CEO) of the company. Schmidt, who previously had held the same positions at the software company Novell Inc., had a doctorate in <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/science/computer-science\">computer science</a> and <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/melded\">melded</a> well with the technocratic impulses of the founders. During Schmidt’s reign as CEO, Page served as president of products, and Brin was president of technology. The trio ran the company as a “triumvirate” until Page took on the CEO role in 2011, Schmidt became executive chairman, and Brin adopted the title of director of special projects.</p><p>Get a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.<a href=\"https://premium.britannica.com/premium-membership/?utm_source=inline&amp;utm_medium=mendel&amp;utm_campaign=evergreen\"><strong>Subscribe Now</strong></a></p><p>The company’s <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/initial-public-offering\">initial public offering</a> (IPO) in 2004 raised $1.66 billion for the company and made Brin and Page instant billionaires. In fact, the IPO created 7 billionaires and 900 millionaires from the early stockholders. The stock offering also made news because of the unusual way it was handled. Shares were sold in a public auction intended to put the average investor on an equal footing with financial industry professionals. Google was added to Standard and Poor’s 500 (<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/SandP-500\">S&amp;P 500</a>) stock index in 2006. In 2012 Google’s market capitalization made it one of the largest American companies not in the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Dow-Jones-average\">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a>.</p>",
